## Problem Title
Smart Waste Management System
## Problem Description
Background: Waste management is a significant challenge in urban and rural areas, leading to pollution, landfills, and inefficient garbage collection. Traditional waste management methods lack efficiency, proper segregation, and monitoring. The Smart Waste Management System (SWMS) aims to address these issues using IoT, AI, and Cloud technologies to enhance waste collection, segregation, and disposal processes.
