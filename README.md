## Problem Title
Smart Waste Management System
## Problem Description
Background: Waste management is a significant challenge in urban and rural areas, leading to pollution, landfills, and inefficient garbage collection. Traditional waste management methods lack efficiency, proper segregation, and monitoring. The Smart Waste Management System (SWMS) aims to address these issues using IoT, AI, and Cloud technologies to enhance waste collection, segregation, and disposal processes.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Defence

## Idea
1.Automated Waste Segregation: Identify and separate biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable waste.<br>
2.Smart Bins with IoT Sensors: Monitor waste levels and notify authorities for timely collection.<br>
3.Optimized Waste Collection Routes: AI-based system to optimize garbage collection routes and reduce fuel consumption.<br>
4.Recycling Awareness and Incentives: Reward users for proper waste disposal through a mobile app.
## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
### A. Smart Waste Segregation System
1.Uses AI and Machine Learning for real-time waste classification.<br>
2.Image processing with cameras to identify different types of waste.<br>
3.Conveyor belt with robotic arms to sort the waste into categories.<br>
### B. IoT-enabled Smart Bins
1.Smart bins equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect waste levels.<br>
2.Bins automatically notify municipal authorities when full.<br>
3.QR-code scanning for users to get incentives for responsible waste disposal.<br>
### C. AI-based Waste Collection Optimization
1.AI-powered system to analyze waste levels across the city.<br>
2.Dynamic route optimization for garbage collection trucks using GPS.<br>
3.Reduces fuel consumption and ensures timely waste pickup.<br>
### D. Mobile App for Public Engagement
1.Citizens can report overflowing bins and illegal dumping.<br>
2.Users get points for properly segregating and disposing of waste.<br>
3.Gamification & Rewards: Points can be redeemed for discounts or coupons.<br>
